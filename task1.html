                <td><p>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads. He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms. He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/">Read More</a></p></td>

                <td><p><b>N</b>etaji Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist leader who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence against British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Bose was a brilliant student, earning a degree from the University of Calcutta and later going to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS). However, his passion for India's freedom led him to abandon his ICS aspirations and join the Indian National Congress (INC). Bose quickly rose through the ranks of the INC, becoming known for his radical views and his advocacy for complete independence from British rule, as opposed to the more moderate approach favoured by some leaders. He was elected as the President of the INC in 1938 and 1939 but resigned due to differences with Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders over their non-violent approach.<a href="https://culture.gov.in/netaji-subhas-chandra-bose">Read More</a></p></td>
